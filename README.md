# ALE-REPL

Generic REPL Generator and Interpreter for languages designed to run on the [ALE](https://github.com/gemoc/ale-lang) Engine.

Also includes bindings for Jupyter notebooks, that require a specific [kernel](https://github.com/pjeanjean/gemoc-jupyter).

You will need to import the projects from [this repository](https://github.com/pjeanjean/ThingML) in order to use ThingML.
